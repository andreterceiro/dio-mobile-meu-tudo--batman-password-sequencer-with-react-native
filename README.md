### Creating the project

Please type this command in the terminal:

```
npx create-expo-app bat-pass-app -t
```

I requested by terminal to confirm the installation of 'create-expo-app'. After the installation, when requested to select a template, I selected "Blank (TypeScript)".

Then I entered in the created directory (`cd bat-pass-app`).


### Installing the dependencies

Before run the project, I installed the project dependencies with the following command:

```
npm install
```


### Running the project

```
npm run start
```


### Seeing the project in the app

To see the project in the App, in the Expo App already installed in the cellphone, I scanned the QR code showed by the command `npm run start`.
